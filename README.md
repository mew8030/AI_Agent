# AI_Agent
If you've ever used OpenCode, Cursor, or Claude Code as an "agentic" AI tool, you'll understand what we're building in this project.  We're building a toy version of Claude Code using Google's Gemini API! As long as you have an LLM at your disposal, it's actually surprisingly simple to build a (somewhat) effective custom agent.
